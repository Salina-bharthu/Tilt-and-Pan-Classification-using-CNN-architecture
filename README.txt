As a part of Deep Learning (COSC2779) Assignment-1, two .ipynb notebook instances and two .py instances of the same .ipynb files are created. 

1. PanClassificationModel.ipynb
	This jupyter notebook contain implementation of classification model, developed to predict the pan angles of headpose. After importing the required data files (given as a part of this assignment), the file can be run without any external dependency by select kernel -> run all. (Warning : The file contains code blocks that require long execution time, therefore, comment parameter tuning section while running) The deatiled explanation of the implementation steps, that are similar for both pan classification and tilt classification models, is given only in this notebook, therefore, it is advisible to go throgh this file first for detailed walkthrough.

2. TiltClassificationModel.ipynb
	This jupyter notebook contain implementation of classification model developed, to predict the tilt angle of headpose. After importing the required data files (given as a part of this assignment), the file can be run without any external dependency by select kernel -> run all. (Warning : The file contains code blocks that require long execution time, therefore, comment parameter tuning section while running) 

3. panclassificationmodel.py 
	Python file of PanClassification.ipynb notebook.

4. tiltclassificationmodel.py
  	Python file of TiltClassification.ipynb notebook.
